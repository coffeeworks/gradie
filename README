Trying to come up with a nice way to DRY up the process of generating background images for website styling.
The desire syntax would be something like:

image('background-header.png', :width => 5) do
  gradient :white, '#BCBCBC', :height => 50
  solid :red, :height => 10
  gradient '#BCBCBC', :transparent, height => 50
end
